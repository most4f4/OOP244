During this workshop, I used some new things I learnt in C++ programming.
One of the main things was about namespaces. They help us organize our code
and avoid name conflicts. By putting related code inside a namespace, we can
make sure that the names we use are unique and won't clash with other parts 
of the code.
I also learned about using namespaces, which makes it easier to access the 
code inside a namespace. Instead of typing the namespace name every time, 
we can use the "using namespace" command to make things simpler and more 
readable.
Another useful concept I learned was how to break down my code into smaller 
parts. This helps make the code easier to manage, allows for reusability, 
and makes it easier for multiple programmers to work together. By dividing 
the code into smaller modules, we can keep things organized and make it 
easier to maintain.
I also learned and used the one-definition-rule. This rule says that each part
of the code should only have one definition. This is important because having
multiple definitions can cause errors and unpredictable behavior. 
Understanding and following this rule ensures that we don't have duplicate 
definitions causing problems. This together with forward declaration was an 
important part of completing one of the main header files in this assignment.
Lastly, I learned about the "#include <iostream>" header file. This file gives
us access to input and output operations. It allows us to do things like 
reading user input and displaying output on the screen. It's an important part
of console-based applications.
While learning all of this, I faced some challenges. Understanding namespaces
and how to use them took some time and effort. It was also a bit tricky to 
figure out how to break down my code into smaller modules, but in the lab
session, I got the hang of it.
Overall, this workshop gave me valuable knowledge and skills in using 
namespaces, breaking down code into modules, following the one-definition-rule,
and using the "<iostream>" header file. I'm confident that these new skills 
will help me write better-organized and structured code in the future, despite
the challenges I faced along the way.
