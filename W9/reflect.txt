In completing this workshop, I learned and used several key concepts and 
techniques in object oriented programming.
One of the fundamental principles I applied was the Rule of Three when 
derived classes with resources are concerned, which emphasizes the 
importance of defining a custom destructor, copy constructor, and copy 
assignment operator when a class manages dynamically allocated memory. 
Implementing this rule, especially in the context of derived classes, 
provided me with a better understanding of resource management in 
object-oriented programming.

Another significant milestones in the project was the ability to effectively
read a file into dynamically allocated memory. 
By utilizing the C++ standard library classes like ifstream, getline, and 
dynamically allocated arrays, I implemented a mechanism to load the content 
of a text file. This process required careful consideration of memory 
allocation, deallocation, and handling special characters within the file.

One challenge I encountered was understanding the intricacies of deep copying
and memory management. Implementing the Rule of Three, especially in a derived
class, required meticulous attention to detail. Ensuring that dynamically 
allocated memory is properly copied, released, and preventing memory leaks 
required careful consideration of every code snippet.

This workshop and the associated project were useful in reinforcing my 
understanding of C++ principles. The experience of implementing the rule of
three, working with file I/O, and processing characters for HTML conversion
expanded my knowledge base.
