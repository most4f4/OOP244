Throughout this workshop project, I gained valuable insights into object-oriented
programming and file input/output operations. Here are some key aspects I learned
and the challenges I encountered:

- Copy Constructors: I discovered the concept of copy constructors, which allowed 
me to create a new object that is an exact replica of the original object. This 
was beneficial in situations where I needed to create independent copies without 
any shared resources.

- Copy Assignment: I learned about copy assignment, which enabled me to update an 
object with new values without creating a new instance. This approach proved to be 
efficient and time-saving.

- Preventing Copying and Assignment: I realized that in certain cases, copying or 
assigning objects can lead to unintended consequences or issues with resource 
management. To address this, I learned how to prevent copying or assignment by 
defining private copy constructors or assignment operators.

- Overloading Insertion Operator (<<): I discovered how to customize the output 
of my objects by overloading the insertion operator (<<). This allowed me to 
define how my objects are displayed when using the standard output stream.

- Overloading Extraction Operator (>>): I learned how to read input and load it 
into my objects by overloading the extraction operator (>>). This gave me the 
ability to define the behavior of reading data from the standard input stream 
into my objects.

- File Input/Output: I acquired knowledge on reading data from files and saving 
data to files using ifstream and ofstream. This allowed me to store important 
information in files or retrieve data from them whenever necessary.

During the project, I encountered several challenges. One notable challenge was 
managing resources properly, particularly with dynamic memory allocation. It was
crucial to allocate memory for objects and deallocate it when no longer needed to
prevent memory leaks. Additionally, I faced difficulties in implementing the copy
constructor and copy assignment operator correctly. It was essential to ensure 
that the copied object had its independent resources and didn't share any pointers
or memory with the original object.

Overall, by tackling these challenges and persistently working through them, I 
successfully completed the project and deepened my understanding of object-oriented
programming and file operations.
