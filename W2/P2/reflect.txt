In programming, a function parameter can be either an in parameter or an out
parameter.
An in parameter is used to pass data into a function. It provides values or 
information that the function needs to perform its task. The function can read
and use the values of the in parameters but cannot modify them. It's like 
giving input to a function and expecting some result.

On the other hand, an out parameter is used to pass data out of a function. It
is used when the function needs to return multiple values or modify the original
value of a variable passed to it. The function can modify the value of the out
parameter and return the updated value to the caller. It's like getting some 
additional information or results from a function.

The load() function takes a PostalCode& post parameter, which is a reference to
a PostalCode object. The function reads data from some source and modifies the
post object by assigning values to its member variables (code and population). 
The function uses the provided post object to store the loaded data, so it acts
as an in parameter.
