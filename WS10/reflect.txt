Working on this assignment allowed me to learn more about function templates. 
Think of function templates as reusable templates for functions that can work
with different types of data. It's like having a blueprint for a function that
can handle various kinds of information without having to rewrite the same 
code over and over again.

I had to make sure I understood how to create these templates correctly, 
including the syntax and how to use them with different types of data. I faced
some challenges along the way, like figuring out the right way to write the 
templates and fix errors that popped up. Also, I had to make sure the templates
could work smoothly with existing code and classes.

In the end, I not only learned how to use function templates effectively, but 
I also gained a better understanding of how to write code that's flexible, easy
to reuse, and adaptable to different situations. This experience helped me 
improve my problem-solving skills and gave me confidence in my ability to work 
with this important programming concept.
