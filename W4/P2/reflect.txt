During this workshop, I learned and applied important concepts in object-oriented
programming. One of the main things I learned was how to create different types
of constructors. Constructors are special functions that help initialize objects.
I learned how to create a default constructor, which is used when an object is  
created without any specific values. I also learned how to create custom
constructors that take different arguments, allowing me to set specific values
when creating objects.

Another important concept was the destructor. The destructor is a special function
that is called when an object is no longer needed. Its purpose is to clean up any 
resources or memory that the object has used. By defining a destructor, I can ensure
that memory is properly released, preventing memory leaks and improving the efficiency
of my program.

I also learned about using references to the current object. This allows me to work 
with the object directly, rather than creating a separate copy. It's a convenient way
to access and modify the object's data within its member functions.

Throughout the workshop, I practiced working with dynamic memory allocation. This 
involves allocating memory for objects or arrays dynamically at runtime. I learned 
how to properly manage this memory by deallocating it in the destructor, preventing 
memory leaks and ensuring efficient memory usage.

While working on the workshop, I faced some challenges in understanding certain 
functions like cin.getline(). However, by studying the provided code examples, I was
able to overcome the difficulties and successfully implement the required functionality.

Overall, this workshop provided me with a solid understanding of constructors, 
destructors, dynamic memory allocation, and object manipulation. It emphasized the 
importance of memory management and taught me how to create and manage objects 
effectively in an object-oriented programming environment.
